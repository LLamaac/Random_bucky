# Random_bucky
Code for Random bucky

# READ PLZ!!!!
This code has no stop switch! it kinda sucks!
The bindings are made for Shipwrecked 64, once started this program will spit out random inputs with mouse movements!
There are versions for Arduino leonardo and UnoR4
Remember that once the Arduino is plugged in and flashed with the code the only way to stop it is to unplug the Arduino!!!
The program is based if of Linksing a program built for Link to play the ocarina forever, it's also included!
Plz credit if used!
